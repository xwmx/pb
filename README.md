# pb

A tiny wrapper combining `pbcopy` &amp; `pbpaste` in a single command.

Copy to or paste from the macOS / OS X clipboard / pasteboards. With no
input, `pb` prints the current contents of the clipboard to stdout using the
`pbpaste` command. When input is passed via stdin or an argument, `pb` acts as
a wrapper for `pbcopy`, which in the simplest case means that it replaces the
clipboard contents with the input. `pb` also includes a `pb --clear` flag
to easily clear the macOS clipboard.

```bash
# save the string "Example text." to the clipboard
> pb "Example text."

# print the clipboard contents
> pb
Example text.

# save the string "Example piped text." to the clipboard
> echo "Example piped text." | pb

# print the clipboard contents
> pb
Example piped text.

# clear the clipboard contents
> pb --clear
Pasteboards / Clipboard cleared.
```

## Background and Terminology

macOS refers to the clipboard as the pasteboard. There are multiple
pasteboards, with "general" as the default that is used when no
pasteboard is specified. The "general" pasteboard is also used in
[Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209460).
